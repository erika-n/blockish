# Blockish: Fractal music in MIDI

This program uses a fractal algorithm to create a MIDI track. The fractal is defined by a few transformations that create a rhythmic seed, which is then expanded to form a larger piece of music. The algorithm can be seen as an extension of the [Cantor set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set). It is also equivalent to a [fractal tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_canopy). See [my explanation](https://www.fractalmusicmachine.com/about.html) for more about fractal music.


## Usage

python fractal-midi.py

Output: fractal-midi.mid

Futz with transformations and depth within the code to produce novel fractals. Render the MIDI with your favorite DAW.
